## FakeImageExploiter v1.1 - backdoor images.jpg[.exe]
    CodeName: troia_revisited

## Legal Disclamer:
    The author does not hold any responsibility for the bad use of this tool,
    remember that attacking targets without prior consent is illegal and punished by law.

<br /><br />

## Description:
    This module takes one existing image.jpg and one payload.exe (input by user) and
    builds a new payload (agent.jpg.exe) that if executed it will trigger the download
    of the 2 previous files stored into apache2 webserver (image.jpg + payload.exe).
    This module also changes the agent Icon to match one file.jpg icon. Then uses
    'hide known file extensions' to hidde the .exe extension (final: agent.jpg.exe) ..


 
## Exploitation:
    FakeImageExploiter stores all files in apache2 webroot, zips (.zip) the agent,
    starts apache2 and metasploit services(handler), and provides a URL to send to
    target (triggers agent.zip download). As soon as the victim runs our executable,
    our picture will be downloaded and opened in the default picture viewer, our
    malicious payload will be executed, and we will get a meterpreter session.

    But it also stores the agent (not ziped) into FakeImageExploiter/output folder
    if we wish to deliver agent.jpg.exe using another diferent attack vector.

    'This tool will upload all files to apache2, and starts payload currespondent handler' 



## Payloads accepted (user input):
    payload.exe | payload.ps1 | payload.txt [Metasploit]



## Pictures accepted (user input):
    All pictures with .jpg (default) | .jpeg | .bmp  extensions (all sizes)
    "Edit 'settings' file before runing tool to sellect another extension"

<br /><br />
