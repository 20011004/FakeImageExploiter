## Legal Disclamer:

    of this tool, remember that attacking targets without prior
    consent is illegal and punished by law.



## Description:
    This module takes one existing image.jpg and one payload.exe (input by user) and
    builds a new payload (evil.jpg.exe) that if executed it will trigger the download
    of the 2 previous files stored into apache2 webserver (image.jpg + payload.exe).
    This module also changes the payload Icon to match one file.jpg icon. Then uses
    'hide known file extensions' to hidde the .exe extension (final: evil.jpg.exe) ..
 
## Exploitation:
    evil.jpg.exe final binary should be deliver to target using social enginnering
    (apache2) As soon as the victim runs our executable, our picture will be downloaded
    and opened in the default picture viewer, our malicious payload will be executed,
    and we will get a meterpreter session.
